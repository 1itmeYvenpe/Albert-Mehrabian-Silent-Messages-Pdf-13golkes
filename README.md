*Silent Messages* is a book that explores how people communicate their feelings and attitudes through various channels, such as facial expressions, gestures, posture, voice, eye contact, and touch. Mehrabian argues that these nonverbal signals are more powerful and reliable than words in conveying emotions and attitudes, especially when there is a discrepancy or inconsistency between verbal and nonverbal messages. He also presents his famous formula for calculating the relative impact of verbal and nonverbal messages on the receiver's feelings: 7% verbal, 38% vocal, and 55% facial.
     
The book is based on Mehrabian's extensive experimental studies, which involved manipulating various aspects of verbal and nonverbal communication and measuring their effects on the participants' emotional reactions. The book also provides practical suggestions and examples for improving one's communication skills and enhancing one's personal and professional relationships.

The book has been widely cited and influential in the fields of psychology, communication, education, business, and politics. However, it has also been criticized and misinterpreted by some scholars and practitioners, who have either oversimplified or overgeneralized Mehrabian's findings. For instance, some people have mistakenly claimed that Mehrabian's formula applies to all types of communication or that nonverbal communication always dominates verbal communication. Mehrabian himself has clarified that his formula only applies to situations where the speaker's attitude or emotion is ambiguous or incongruent with the words, and that verbal communication is still important for conveying factual information and logical arguments.
     
The book is available in various formats, including hardcover, paperback, and PDF. However, some online sources have added a suffix "13golkes" to the title of the PDF version, which is apparently a typo or a spam word. The correct title of the PDF version is simply *Silent Messages: Implicit Communication of Emotions and Attitudes*. The PDF version can be downloaded for free from several websites, such as [Academia.edu], [Internet Archive], [Open Library], etc.
